			<h1 class="slide-header">Why Become a Developer?</h1>
			<div class="columns">
				<p>So at some point, I started selling insurance. Which lead to a sales internship that was designed for college students at the sister-company, whereafter I tried to recruit a friend to join me, who ended up recruting me to start a lawn mowing business, which made me go to youtube and learn to make a crappy wordpress site... which made me teach myself HTML/CSS through youtube videos, which inspired me to go back to school for a degree in web development.</p><br/>
				<p> Fast forward three years and I have a little more than one semester left for a two year degree. They do not teach Node, they do not teach Angular, they did not teach SASS/LESS/SCSS, or a number of other technologies that I see show up repeatedly in job listings.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Meanwhile, I've been paying cash for school to avoid student loans, and found out along the way my "web technologies" degree is really a two year degree to be a Java developer. I've also realized the internet has little to do with Java and javascript is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH-7083VqdU&t=0m4s">'da real MVP'.</a></p><br/>
				<p>Even if my school had an epiphany tomorrow, and decided to start teaching the MEAN stack, it would be 2-3 years <i>minimum</i> before they could because of State funding and beauracracy.</p><br/>
				<p>So while I'm chipping away at this degree and getting closer to chopping down a tree I don't really want, I'm paying cash for tuition to avoid student loans, my car is depreciating, I'm not cashflowing enough for new clothes, or to buy anything really that's not a necessity. My computer was bought in 2009. My phone is from Obama's first term.</p><br/>
				<p>I have no doubt that I have the intellectual capacity, and common sense soft-skills that I could contribute somewhere as a developer and probably make as much in my first year as I have the rest of my life put together.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>I want to change the trajectory of my life and I think a coding bootcamp is the best way to do that. Honestly my interest in Prime stems primarily from geography. I live 4-5 hours from Bloomington right now, and I lived in the twin cities for about a year. I have friends and people I know that live there too. To be completely honest, if I had a blank check to go to any of these coding bootcamps I'd go to HackReactor, but that's just not financially realistic, between the higher than average tuition, and insane cost of living in the bay area.</p><br/>
				<p>The thought may come across the reader's mind, why not just quit school and get a full time job? Well, I could. But I don't want to do anything other than web development. Except for maybe flipping houses, but that's capital intensive and I still would rathre do web development.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>There are so many awesome companies that are hiring developers. I wish I were qualified to apply to an Air BnB, or a Hudl, but I'm not right now. I want to learn javascript from developers who have done it for a living, can teach best practices, catch bad habits, and teach how to be part of a software team.</p><br/>
				<p>Bottom line: It would be a night and day difference to go to work 6 months from now as a Full Stack Developer and be making meaningful money so I can be self-sufficient.</p><br/>
				<p>That's the short-term. Long-term, I have a few ideas that I don't have the skills to construct yet.</p>

				<h2>INTERESTS</h2>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Web development</summary>
					<p>HTML, CSS & Javascript. It's the closest thing there is to magic. You type characters, and stuff appears. It's so cool. But it's not just novel, it solves problems and makes the world better.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Basketball</summary>
					<p>#1 way to unplug. I'm a big man in a guards body and the low post is my natural habitat.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Making people laugh</summary>
					<p>It just makes the day more interesting.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Soccer</summary>
					<p>My best sport. But soccer goals are less ubiquitous than basketball hoops and the participation threshold is higher. <abbr title="too long; didn't read">TL;DR</abbr> &mdash; not very many goals and hard to get enough people</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Scrabble</summary>
					<p>I'm uncommonly good. Although, the last time I lived in the Twin Cities when I'd play club, I'd get my ass handed to me. I've improved quite a bit since then though.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Austrian Economics</summary>
					<p>People aren't pawns on a chessboard. Studying economics through the lens of human action differentiates it from other schools, and to my knowledge, the Austrians are the only one's to have a working theory of the business cycle.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Design</summary>
					<p>Things can always be improved, and I think that's what design is always about. Whether its a figurative face-lift, or better functionality. Although, I'll admit, sometimes listening to designers talk about design can be an insufferable experience.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Music Production</summary>
					<p>I make beats and small compositions on my computer. I wish I had a solid understanding of music theory.</p>
				</details>
