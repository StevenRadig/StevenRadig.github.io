			<h1 class="slide-header">Why Become a Developer?</h1>
			<div id="slide1_container">
				<p>So at some point, I started selling insurance. Which lead to a sales internship that was designed for college students at the sister-company, whereafter I tried to recruit a friend to join me, who ended up recruiting me to start a lawn mowing business, which made me go to youtube and learn to make a crappy wordpress site... which made me teach myself HTML/CSS through youtube videos, which inspired me to go back to school for a degree in web development.</p>
			  <br/>
				<p> Fast forward a few years and I have a few credits left to graduate. I love how web development combines art, math, and logic.</p>

				<h2>INTERESTS</h2>
				
				<details>
					<summary>Web development</summary>
					<p>In my opinion, it's the closest thing there is to magic. You type characters, and stuff appears. It is so cool. But it's not just fun, it solves problems and makes the world better.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Basketball</summary>
					<p>I could probably count the number of times I've said 'no' to a pick up game on one hand.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Making people laugh</summary>
					<p>This one is self-explanatory.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Soccer</summary>
					<p>Soccer is my best sport, but goals are less ubiquitous than basketball hoops and the participation threshold is higher. <abbr title="too long; didn't read">Tl;dr</abbr> &mdash; not very many goals and hard to get enough people</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Scrabble</summary>
					<p>I'm uncommonly good - like I can't play with friends or family anymore. I've been playing less though in the past few months and programming more.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Austrian Economics</summary>
					<p>People aren't pawns on a chessboard. Viewing economics through praxeology or human action differentiates it from other schools, and to my knowledge, the Austrians are the only one's to have a working theory of the business cycle.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Design</summary>
					<p>I like it when things I use do what they are supposed to easily and are visually attractive.</p>
				</details>
				<details>
					<summary>Music Production</summary>
					<p>I make beats and small compositions on my computer. I wish I had a comprehensive understanding of music theory.</p>
				</details>

						<p>Described to me as the "Most Promising New-Comer Award", it's an award I was given for my performance in a Des Moines Scrabble tournament.
